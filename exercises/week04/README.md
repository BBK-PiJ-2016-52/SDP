# Everthing is an Object
## In Scala everything is an object

##### We interact with object by
##### calling methods
##### accessing fields

##### Object and Classes
* A class is a type
* An object is a value

Syntax for defining fields
Example:
```
val name = expression
val name: Type = expression
val firstName = "Garfield"
val secondName: String = "Cat"
```
