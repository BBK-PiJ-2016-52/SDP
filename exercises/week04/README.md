# Everthing is an Object
## In Scala everything is an object

##### We interact with object by
##### calling methods
##### accessing fields

##### Object and Classes
* A class is a type
* An object is a value

Syntax for defining *fields*
Example:
```
val name = expression
val name: Type = expression

val firstName = "Garfield"
val secondName: String = "Cat"
```

Syntax for defining *methods*
Example:
```
def name(arg1: Type, arg2: Type, ...): Type = {
// body goes here
}

def sayHello(other: Type): String = {
firstName + " says hello to " + other
}
```
